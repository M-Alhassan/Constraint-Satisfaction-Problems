# Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems
Solving CSPs (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) using backtracking algorithm with AC-3 Arc-consistency algorithm to enforce binary constraints and MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) heuristic to choose the variable with the fewest remaining legal values next for assignment.

## ‚ùì CSP examples

- Scheduling: Schedule meetings/classes/shifts between poeple with time constraints.
- Cheapest Flight: finding cheap flights including transit flights with time constraints.
- Map Coloring: Color map such that no two adjacent cities have the same color/value.
- N-Queens: N-Queens in an NxN chessboard positioning such that no two queens are attacking each other.
- Sudoku: Combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
- and many more


## ‚ö° Heuristics

- <b>Minimum Remaining Values (MRV):</b> choose the variable with the fewest remaining legal values next for assignment.


## üìà Algorithms:

- <b>Backtracking:</b> finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

- <b>AC-3:</b> Enforce Arc-consistency by repeatedly removing unsupported values from the domains of its variables.

## üîß Installation

1. Install newest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Run ```test_csp.py``` for map coloring problem
